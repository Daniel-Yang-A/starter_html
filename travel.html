            <p>An object of discord, desire and fascination, the Eiffel Tower never fails to impress. 
                Enriched by a history full of new developments, here you can discover all of its key 
                information.</p>
            <p>It was for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, the date that marked the 100th anniversary 
                of the French Revolution, that a great competition was launched in 1886.</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: Asian</h3>

            <p>Often capped with snow, Mount Fuji's gently sloping volcano is Japan's definition of 
                perfection. Revered by locals, the 12,388-foot summit is open to hikers in certain 
                seasons. Most visitors opt for a sighting, either from Tokyo's sky-high observation 
                decks or a passing bullet train heading to Osaka.</p>
            <p>For a closer view, visit the Fuji Five Lakes region for its hot springs or to begin 
                your hike of Mount Fuji. Views from here are best in the early morning or late 
                afternoon, between November and May. Meanwhile, skiers may want to visit during 
                the winter months. For one-of-a-kind views, go to Oshino Hakkai, which is a series 
                of eight ponds fed by the mountain's underground reservoir amid wooden bridges and 
                rambling walkways in the Mount Fuji World Heritage Site.</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>

            <p>Officially known as "The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World," the copper Lady 
                Liberty was gifted by France as a symbol of friendship and dedicated in 1886. 
                Conserved by the National Park Service, it can be easily seen from the free Staten 
                Island Ferry.</p>
            <p>Travelers should note that to tour the museum at its base or climb the 377-step 
                spiral staircase into the crown, you must book ahead with Statue Cruises or select 
                from a variety of guided tour options. If you want to wake up to views of Lady 
                Liberty, spend the night in New York City at The Wagner at The Battery, a traveler 
                favorite with exceptional views near Wall Street.</p>

            <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.
