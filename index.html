            <h2>Persian Cat</h2>
            <img src="images/persian-cat-breed.jpg" width="400" alt="silver persian cat lounging on a sunny windowsill">

            <p>Persian cats are thought to be one of the oldest cat breeds, dating as far back as the 1600s. They appear 
                in Persian historical records as "the long-haired beauties," says Maggie Shuter, a Certified Feline Behavior 
                Consultant (CFBC). Cat-lovers and historians alike say Persians roamed the world as popular companions 
                on caravans and alongside world travelers. Even Queen Victoria had two Persians, and in 1871 the sought-after 
                breed made a show-winning appearance at the very first modern cat show.</p>
            <P>Today, Persian cats continue to charm their way to the top of popular breed lists. While they come with a 
                fair share of fur maintenance, Persians are docile, intelligent, and make great companions in mellow households. 
                And while they come in over 50 shades and color combinations, Persian cats are easily identified by their 
                smooshed-in faces, big eyes, and lustrous coats. They have stocky bodies, averaging 10-15 inches in height 
                and weighing 7-13 pounds.</P>

            <h2>Goldfish</h2>
            <img src="images/Common_goldfish.jpg" width="400" alt="a red goldfish">

            <p>The Goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. 
                It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium fish. Goldfish 
                released into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North America.</p>
            <P>Native to China, the goldfish is a relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the 
                Prussian carp and the crucian carp). It was first selectively bred for color in imperial China more than 
                1,000 years ago, where several distinct breeds were developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, 
                body shape, fin configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, 
                and black are known).</P>

            <h2>Horse</h2>
            <img src="images/horse_main.jpg" width="400" alt="a brown horse">

            <p>
                Owning a horse is a very rewarding experience, but it is not for everyone. Be sure to thoroughly 
                research before taking on the responsibility of owning a horse. If you want to learn to ride it is 
                a good idea to take horseback riding lessons. If you enjoy it you may want to consider leasing a 
                horse. There are many barns which will board your horse for you and allow you to come and ride 
                anytime. Some of them will do the majority of the work involved in owning a horse, however this 
                can get pricey. Know the horse you are riding. Horses spook very easily. Simple things like sticks 
                and forest animals commonly spook horses. When riding a horse a helmet should be worn at all times.
            </p>
            <P>RidingThere are two different types of riding, Western and English. Western generally consists of 
                barrel racing, keyhole and pole racing among other events, whereas English generally consists of 
                dressage, jumping, polo, Lacrosse and more. When dressage is performed it looks like the horse is 
                dancing. The rider is guiding the horse through a series of complex maneuvers by slight movements of 
                the rider's hands, legs and weight. The saddle a Western rider uses is different than the saddle an 
                English rider would use. One key difference is the Western saddle consists of a horn, while the 
                English saddle does not.</P>

            <h2>Parrot</h2>
            <img src="images/parrot_main.jpg" width="400" alt="a red Parrot">

            <p>Parrots are birds of roughly 398 species, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions (the 
                greatest diversity living in Australasia and South America). The order is subdivided into three 
                superfamilies: the Psittacoidea ("true" parrots), the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots), and 
                the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos). Characteristic features of parrots are their curved bill, clawed 
                zygodactyl feet, strong legs, and upright stance. Many parrots are vividly colored.</p>

            <P>Parrots are noisy animals who need freedom to live happily. The parrots' loud vocalizations help 
                them in the wild to communicate with other parrots in the distance. The larger species of parrots 
                have ear shattering screams that can be heard from miles away.</P>

            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
